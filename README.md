# Habitable Planets

An application that returns list of human habitable planets with details. This application uses the planet's data available on https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KeplerMission.html. This is a downloaded version, so future update might have more data

I built this app to learn how to stream data and process csv file contents.
